# Rules

Please read and understand the rules of the WiCyS CTF competition before registering and starting any challenges. If you have questions about the rules, please contact CTF support at: wictf-support@sei.cmu.edu.

## Team Composition

WiCyS 2022 CTF is a team event. 

1. Teams of two to four participants are permitted to compete in the CTF.
2. Participants can compete on **one team only**. 
3. Participants cannot change teams during the CTF.
4. Once a team is locked during registration, it cannot be changed later.
>**Reminder:** A team is locked when the CTF gameboard is launched.

## Conduct

1. Violation of the Rules of Conduct as outlined may result in disqualification from the CTF.
2. When choosing team and individual nicknames, competitors will show decorum and refrain from any names that are vulgar or political in nature. Names will go through an approval process before appearing on the leaderboard. Inappropriate language, references to political persons or parties, or otherwise inappropriate content will be asked to be changed. The CTF staff reserves the right to ask any team or individual to change their name and maintains final judgement on what is acceptable.
3. Any attempts at unauthorized access or “Denial of Service” attacks are forbidden and will result in disqualification. “Escaping” the virtual machines or otherwise tampering with or targeting the hosting environment is prohibited.

## Tiebreaker

In the event of a tie, the "Cumulative Time" will be used to determine the winner. Cumulative Time is the _total time spent in challenges successfully solved_. This is calculated using a timer specific to each challenge on your gameboard. When you start a challenge, the timer starts. When you successfully solve a challenge, your score and cumulative time are updated on the leaderboard.
