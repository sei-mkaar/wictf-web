# Rules

These are the rules of the competition. Please read them carefully.

## Team Composition

WiCyS 2022 CTF is a team event. 

1. Team of 2 to 4 members is allowed to participate in the CTF.
2. Participants can only be on one team and cannot change teams during the CTF.
3. Once a team is locked during registration, it can NOT be changed later.

## Conduct
1. Violation of the Rules of Conduct as outlined may result in disqualification from the CTF.
2. When choosing team and individual nicknames, competitors will show decorum and refrain from any names that are vulgar or political in nature. Names will go through an approval process before appearing on the leaderboard. Inappropriate language, references to political persons or parties, or otherwise inappropriate content will be asked to be changed. The CTF staff reserves the right to ask any team or individual to change their name and maintains final judgement on what is acceptable.
3. Any attempts at unauthorized access or “Denial of Service” attacks are forbidden and will result in disqualification. “Escaping” the virtual machines or otherwise tampering with or targeting the hosting environment is prohibited.

## Tiebreaker
In the event of a tiebreaker, the "Cumulative Time" will be used to determine the winners. The Cumulative Time is the total time spent in challenges successfully solved. This is calculated using a timer specific to each challenge on your game board. When you start a challenge, the timer starts. When you successfully solve a challenge, your score and cumulative time are updated on the leaderboard.
