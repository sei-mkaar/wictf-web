If you can\u2019t find the answer here, please contact us. What does \"Cumulative Time\" on the leaderboard mean? The Cumulative Time column is only used for tiebreaking purposes. When a challenge is started, a timer tracks how long it takes to solve that challenge. The sum time of all successfully solved challenges is posted to the leaderboard under Cumulative Time. Again, this is for tiebreaking purposes only. Will I need any special software or applications to participate in the CTF? No. All that you need is an up-to-date web browser on your laptop and a good internet connection. Supported browsers are Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. How are ties handled? In the event of a tiebreaker, Cumulative Time will be used to determine the winners. The Cumulative Time is the total time spent in challenges successfully solved. This is calculated using a timer specific to each challenge on your game board. When you start a challenge, the timer starts. When you successfully solve a challenge, your score and cumulative time are updated. Note: Your challenge timer does not stop if you \"delete\" a challenge space or go work on another challenge. If you: start a challenge, then start and work on another challenge, and then return to your previous challenge--your challenge timer is still running. Time spent in challenges failed, or challenges started and not completed, does not count towards your cumulative score. You won't be penalized for trying! One of my team members dropped out. Can I replace them with someone else? No. Once a team is established, members cannot be added. You have the option to compete without that team member. When does registration for the CTF start? Registration opens the week of March 7, 2022 and will remain open until the end of the CTF (March 19, 2022). Can I participate on more than one team at a time? No. You can only be a team member on one team. What if I can't access my email when I'm out of the office? To use multi-factor authentication without access to email, visit your identity profile and select Configure 2FA . You will need to be logged in for this, so make sure you complete this while you do have access to email. There you can generate a Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) secret key. Use this secret key with any totp-enabled authentication app, such as Duo Mobile or Google Authenticator, by simply scanning the barcode. If you don't have access to your device, copy down the secret key and add it into the TOTP app on your device later. Can I copy/paste between my host and the gamespace virtual machines? Yes. The cog icon in the upper-left corner of the virtual machine console allows you to move text bidirectionally between your host and that virtual machine. If I reach my limit of four virtual gamespaces, can I move on to another challenge? Yes. If you start a challenge but would like to move on to another challenge without finishing it, you can DELETE that gamespace. However, the challenge timer will not stop. When you return to this challenge, you can RESTART the gamespace in its original state. Is partial credit available for challenge submissions? Yes. Most challenges have multiple parts which allow competitors to earn partial credit. Each challenge part includes the number of points awarded for providing the correct answer. Note: When you click Submit , all of your answer parts will be sent to the grading server. You are limited to THREE (3) submissions per challenge. This applies whether or not you leave any answer fields empty. Is there a recommended format for answer submissions? Correct answers will vary based on the challenge format and the questions asked. Please refer to the example answer provided beneath each answer submission form field. CTF Support is asking for my challenge Support Code . Where can I find it? The challenge Support Code can be found in the lower-right corner of the challenge pane. The Support Code looks similar to this: a347c5c6 a00 . I am interested in the platform used to run this CTF. Where can I learn more about it? The WiCyS 2022 CTF uses open source software from the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University to develop, deploy and manage the competition. Specifically, the Foundry Appliance \u2014a ready-to-use, competition virtual appliance\u2014was used to quickly deploy the apps for this event.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions-faq","text":"Below you will find some commonly asked questions and answers to help you with the CTF.
